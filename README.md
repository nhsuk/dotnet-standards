## Dotnet coding standards

A coding standard ensures that all developers writing the code in a particular language write according to the guidelines specified. This makes the code easy to understand and provides consistency in the code. One of the most essential factors in a software system is the consistency of the coding standard.

Standardization promotes productivity by eliminating inefficiency. This is the result of eliminating ambiguity and providing quality control: tasks are completed in a more efficient manner, and there are fewer quality control issues from tasks that were not completed correctly the first time around.

- SDMT should make sure all the dotnet projects adheres to these standards.
- SDMT should have regular audits for dotnet projects.
- Any project not following the defined standards should make it a priority to make it upto date.
- This is a living document and SDMT should update/maintain it regularly.
- New employees should go through this documentation as a part of induction.

### Benefits of coding standards:
-  Increases efficiency
-  Minimize the risk of project failure
-  Reduces complexity
-  Maintenance becomes easy
-  Early correction of bugs
-  Provides comprehensive view
-  Cost saving in long run
